# MERN Stack eCommerce with Admin Panel: Project Overview

This project is a feature-rich eCommerce web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Below is an overview of the key functionalities implemented:

## Features:

### 1. Home Page:
- **Dynamic Content:** Displayed dynamic content showcasing featured products and promotions.
- **Intuitive UI:** Designed an intuitive user interface for effortless navigation.

### 2. Shop and Product Search:
- **Product Categories:** Implemented a product categorization system for easy browsing.
- **Search Functionality:** Enabled users to search for products based on keywords, enhancing user experience.

### 3. Cart and Checkout:
- **Add to Cart:** Users can add products to their cart for later purchase.
- **Seamless Checkout:** Implemented a smooth and secure checkout process for efficient order placement.

### 4. Admin Panel:
- **CRUD Operations:** Developed a robust admin panel enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.
- **User Management:** Admins can manage user accounts and permissions effectively.

## Technologies Used:

- **Frontend:** React.js, Material-UI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Payment Gateway:** Integrated secure payment processing using Stripe API.

## How to Run the Project Locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies for the backend: `cd backend && npm install`
3. Install dependencies for the frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
5. Start the frontend development server: `cd frontend && npm start`

## Project Structure:

- **`/ecommerce-site`**: Contains frontend React.js components and styles.
- **`/ecommerce-site-server`**: Houses the Node.js server files, API routes, and database configurations.

## Additional Notes:

- Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally before starting the server.
- Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.
- Stripe API keys need to be configured in the backend for payment processing to work.
